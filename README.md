# Project Description
The purpose of our project is to create an interactive game that primarily focuses on the concepts that were learnt in class and manipulating the functionalities of Python to design a complex yet efficient and easy to comprehend game, UNO.

UNO is one of the most famous and exciting classic card games for both the children (age:7+) and the adults.
It includes a deck 108 cards: four each of "Wild" and "Wild Draw Four," and 13 each of four different colors (red, yellow, green, blue). Each color consists of cards from 0      through 9, and one each of "Skip," "Draw Two," and "Reverse." These last three types are known as "action cards.“
To start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, and a card from the remaining deck will be randomly selected and set aside to begin the play. The first turn will be decided randomly. On a player's turn, they must do one of the following:
play one card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol
play a Wild card, or a playable Wild Draw Four card 
draw the top card from the deck, then play it if possible
The first player to play all of their cards wins the game.

# Game Features
  ## ⦿ REPLAYABILITY
  Choice to play again and again with a different gameplay each time thus keeping the player hooked to the game
  ## ⦿ GAMING ENVIRONMENT
  Action cards create an energizing environment bombarding the player with continuous challenges
  ## ⦿ WINNING CHANCES
  At the beginning of the game, both the player and computer have equal winning chances. Neither of them has an advantage over the other
  ## ⦿ LIMITING INACTIVITY PERIOD
  We will be designing a player vs computer game to keep the player riveted on to the game instead of a multi-player game - which can devastate the player's interest due to long periods of inactivity while waiting for their turns
